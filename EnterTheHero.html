<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call me when you're in a pinch!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chant this three times in your mind!</p>

<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter the Hero!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter the Hero!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter the Hero!</p>

<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do that, I will come to you!"</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">—</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hero comes from a faraway land. His form is similar to ours, a human shape.</p>

<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from his back sprouts broad magnificent wings. His wings flap and he takes off to the
     sky. The embodiment of freedom and movement, the hero soars to those in need. </p>

<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hero has no weakness.</p>

<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hero transcends logic.</p>

<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hero overturns what we thought we knew and drives away the darkness.</p>
    
<p style="text-align: center;">—</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our lives had been so perfect in our youth. We did what we loved: danced, laughed, and played. 
    We practiced instruments, read books, and played sports.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instruments were just like toys, books were portals into wild and wonderful worlds, and sports were just games.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet at some point, somewhere along that transition from middle to high school,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We became aware.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aware of this looming presence, far off in the distance, known as “college”.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aware of how the things we did weren’t just games. We had to be the best we could be: skills, school, 
    sports, anything really.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aware of the eventual need to fit all of our passions, interests, and hobbies into a “life”. Thinking of 
    how to turn it into a career or a hook on a college app.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the inverse, thinking of how we might have to leave them behind as just things we did in our youth, 
    or as old bits of memorabilia catching dust in a closet or bookshelf.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly yet suddenly, we had to figure out how to find a place for all the things we wanted to do in our lives.
     Try to shoot for college sports? Aim for a conservatory? Write novels on the side?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things we did became axes to revolve our lives around. Question after question floods into the mind.
     Why do I pursue this? Am I good enough to keep doing this? Who am I without this?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We realize that unless we are the greatest of all time ever to grace a given hobby or interest, we 
    cannot commit the whole of our life to it, and that, largely due to factors outside of our control—talent, environment, 
    direction—the things we love to do can’t play as big of a role in our lives. We are not Lionel Messi, Mozart, or Shakespeare; 
    we can’t dedicate our whole lives to a single focus and come out unscathed. Thus, as we enter adulthood, we must determine 
    to what extent our childhood pursuits will play a part in our lives—whether to pursue them as far as we can or to leave them 
    behind as golden relics of our youth.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">—</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This coming-of-age transition is central to the 2014 Japanese animated series Ping Pong the Animation, 
    a story that follows five ping pong prodigies as they begin high school as well as their journey to figure out the role that 
    the sport will play in their lives.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The show takes place in Enoshima, Japan, a bustling, beautiful seaside town near Tokyo. The story 
    begins with its two main characters, lifelong best friends Yutaka Hoshino (Peco) and Makoto Tsukimoto (Smile), entering 
    high school, turmoiling in this inflection point of their lives. The pair are the two opposite sides of a coin: Peco, 
    the shining star of ping pong talent, who as a kid ditched class to go win tournaments, who revels in energy and 
    victory—and Smile, a shy recluse, bullied as a kid with names like “Robot” or “Golgo,” who vowed to put aside his desire 
    for happiness, to keep to himself, and to not bother anybody. As children, Peco pulled Smile out of his safe sorrow and 
    taught him how to play ping pong: he loved it. He was inspired by Peco’s raw talent and enjoyment and wanted to be like 
    him—he saw Peco as the Hero.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story begins with turbulence and failure. Competition has become tougher for the two: Peco 
    is destroyed in a humiliating defeat to a Chinese import, and Smile has lost his urge to win as he has begun to see 
    ping pong as “just a way to pass the time until [he] die[s]”(ep. 2).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peco is destroyed by the realization that his talent alone cannot keep carrying him at this point,
     as players who had worked harder have caught up to him. As he laments his defeat, he reminisces on the ease of playing
      in his youth, “The ball would come to hit my racket if I swung it around with my eyes closed. I could fly! I could 
      jump up and touch the moon without breaking a sweat! I didn’t know the meaning of the word ‘miracle’!”(ep. 6). This
       ease was stripped from him entirely in a single defeat. His childhood passion has become a cistern for shame. He 
       compensates nihilistically, throwing his racket off a bridge and leading a life of gorging sweets, smoking cigarettes,
        and dating shallow women.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peco’s pronounced downfall is juxtaposed with Smile’s slow retreat back into his shell. As 
    Smile puts it, “Interacting with people just exhausts me lately. And table tennis is getting more complicated too”(ep. 2).
     As ping pong gets more competitive at this age, Smile becomes less sure of the role it should play in his life, while 
     at the same time he witnesses Peco’s fall from grace—that his Hero has lost his way.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Smile’s coach ignites the intensity of his training, trying to force him out of that
     shell and ignite a thirst for victory. His coach ends up succeeding, as Smile decides that since the Hero is gone, 
     he will embrace his own robotic nature in his play. If he wants to keep playing this sport, he must do what it takes
      to succeed. He calculates the exact formula to victory and optimizes it: maximizing the development of his talent,
       the sharpening of his skill, and the aiming of every shot and swing to defeat all opponents. He finds victory in
        optimizing the logic that his hero used to defy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peco and Smile stay on these trajectories through the first half of the story: Peco wallows
     in purposelessness with the loss of the effortless success of his youth, while Smile becomes emotionlessly ruthless 
     in his ping pong—embodying calculated, precise, and flawless performance—the opposite of Peco’s former fluid, jovial,
      and effortless talent. Smile calculates the path to victory where Peco used to fly to it. The pair’s childhood 
      passion has become work for one and shame for the other. Smile begins to habitually repeat a mantra to himself:
       “My blood tastes like iron.” An affirmation of his robotic nature. Smile has become the Robot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the way of Smile’s warpath is Manabu Sakuma, another first-year who had grown up playing at 
    the same table tennis hall as Smile and Peco. Sakuma was the type who would copy the racket, technique, and strategy 
    of pros and practice as much as he could to hone them. He maximized every facet of his play and worked as hard as he 
    could to perfect it. Sakuma lacked Peco’s talent but made up for it with his grit and work ethic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desperate to prove himself to be on the same level as Peco and Smile, Sakuma challenges Smile,
     staking his career on this match. He is clearly outclassed, and as he’s about to lose the last game, he slams his 
     racket to the ground with the force of years of effort and frustration, yelling:</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why you? Why?! I worked hard! Ten! No, a hundred! A thousand
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;times harder than you!...From dawn until dusk, my only thoughts were
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of table tennis! I’ve given everything I had to table tennis! So why—”
    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile: “Because you haven’t got a talent for table tennis.
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s all there is to it.” (ep. 5)
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cruel indifference of reality slaps Sakuma across the face. He was never meant to reach the 
    pinnacle of table tennis.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six months comes and goes—and Sakuma comes to terms with this realization: he starts working 
    construction and begins dating, leaving the sport he had once dedicated his life to behind in the dust. Due to factors 
    outside of his control, he could not feasibly dedicate his life to ping pong, and he found that that was okay. He pays
     a visit to his old friend Peco—hair overgrown, skin tanned from days wasting away at the beach, and body fat from 
     ice cream bars and condensed milk.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pair walk to a bridge and Sakuma brings his insights to Peco, who had been decaying far 
    away from table tennis for the last half year, urging him to return to the sport, as Sakuma says,</p>


<p style="font-size:14px;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’ve got talent. So keep playing table tennis…after Smile handed
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my ass to me, I did some thinking. It didn’t take me any time to
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe [Smile] about my lack of talent. Now that I’ve accepted
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it, I’m relieved. Let me see clearly too…Sights you can only see
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when competition’s not a factor. You have an outstanding gift
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for table tennis…Why would you stifle so much talent?!...You
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;love table tennis more than anyone else! (ep. 6)
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peco rejects Sakuma’s speech, still distraught over losing the absolute ease he could play with 
    in the past—still unable to dedicate himself to a sport that he wasn’t the best at. Peco runs away from ping pong once more, 
     jumping off the bridge, recapturing a mote of that feeling of flying. As he wades about, he thinks, reassuring
      himself that leaving the sport was the right choice. But rather quickly, he tires himself out, and starts to
       sink into the water.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he’s drowning, he reminisces of himself in his youth—effortlessly flying in the sport, defying all logic, 
    capable of anything—and worries for Smile’s present struggles: his hero losing his way as well as the pressures
     and burdens of competition and victory. He remembers how he inspired Smile and realizes that his fall from grace
      has snuffed out Smile’s ray of hope—his living example that there is no formula to victory and that people can fly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sakuma pulls Peco onto the shore. As Peco is still coughing up water, Sakuma leaves him with some last words of advice,
     “Keep playing table tennis. Keep running until you puke blood. Keep swinging until you crap blood. You’ll feel better
      than you do now, hero”(ep. 6). </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peco is reborn. He resolves to seize his potential to save Smile and begs his old coach to train him once more. She takes
     him to a hundred-meter-high staircase and has him run up it until he pukes. Peco dedicates his life to ping pong once more.</p>
     
<p style="text-align: center;">—</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In time, the interhigh tournament comes once again, the anniversary of Peco’s drastic defeat and his quitting of 
    ping pong. Smile has been marching his warpath of victory after victory leading up to the tournament, while Peco has been training 
    harder than ever, sharpening his skill and honing his style. Both seek to challenge the prior year’s world champion, Ryuuichi Kazama.</p>
    
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kazama lives in a world without heroes. The only person he sees as his true competitor is himself. As he says:</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no shortcut to victory. You must climb that steep mountain
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my ass to me, I did some thinking. It didn’t take me any time to
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one step at a time. There’s an abyss down below, and it never
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ends…Don’t think anybody will save you, because nobody will!
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t want to be bullied, get stronger. Win and win and rise
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the top!”(ep. 10).
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has reached the top of ping pong through a raw, brutal desire to win. Not for the fun of it, but
     from the great expectations that have been placed on his shoulders: to bring honor to his parents, who were looked down 
     upon by the rest of his family, and to his school, which carries the legacy of his grandfather, a former table tennis great.
      Kazama holes up in the bathroom before every match and wallows in fear and isolation, as even though he has reached the 
      pinnacle of the sport—more than surpassing the expectations of his family and school—he sees not the height he has attained,
       but rather only the vast void below him. He plays not for himself nor enjoyment, only to win.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile and Peco are on opposite sides of the bracket and will only face in the finals. But before Peco 
    can reach Smile, he must take down the monster of Kazama.</p>
    
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peco is the embodiment of raw energy and talent in ping pong. He plays all out, flying to each ball, 
    defying logic. Kazama is his antithesis. He plays to win, for he has no other choice. He carries the weight of his family,
     school, and career on his shoulders, putting all that strength behind every swing of his racket.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to their match, Peco and Kazama have a conversation speaking to their clashing spirits:</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peco: “You’re an athlete who’s up real high. You’re way
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up high so I’m gonna climb up on your back…and fly.”
    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kazama: “You’re delusional. People can’t fly.” (ep. 10)
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their match shall decide who is right.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile has been waiting for his Hero for a long time, and he’s finally coming back. As Peco and 
    Kazama are playing, Smile confides in his coach,</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you believe in heroes?...He always appears when I’m in a
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pinch. No matter how trapped I am, he always comes to
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;save me…I’ve been waiting for him for a long time now.
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And today he’s coming back…He’s coming home. (ep. 10)
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">—</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peco loses the first two games. Down 0-5 in game 3, he becomes distraught and stressed, 
    questioning what he should do.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, faintly, in the background, he hears Smile whistling a strange tune from the stairwell.
     Smile calls it the Hero’s song. As Peco listens, he hears the visage of a young Smile in his mind:</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>"Is he a tough opponent?”</i>
    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“He’s the embodiment of table tennis.”
    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>“You can find the fun in it, Peco. Time flies when you’re having fun.</i>
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever you played, you had such a good time you’d forget any injury.
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>You always said the stronger your opponent, the higher you could fly.”</i>
    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah.”
    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>“Can you fly?”</i>
    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah!”
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peco remembers who he is. He is the hero. Kazama is wrong. He can fly. People can fly. He boldly declares:</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Kazama! I’m gonna teach ya something!
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table tennis is a freaking blast!
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peco transcends. He finds the fun in playing the greatest player of his generation in every step and racket 
    stroke. Peco slowly catches up in score. He takes a game. Kazama becomes frustrated, but when Peco taunts him, he eagerly rises to
     roar back. In his effort to catch up to the hero, wings sprout from Kazama’s back as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kazama is flying. He is seen smiling for the first time by his teammates as he revels in the intensity of
     the game and roars with every swing. Peco moves like lightning. The pair step, swing, and slam with all of their cells arranged 
     in harmony, not to win, but for the sake of the game itself.</p>
     
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet Peco does not stop accelerating, as the match reaches its climax, the room around them fades aways. 
    All that’s left is the two of them, the ball, and the table. There is no one else. There is nothing else. All external motivations, 
    burdens, and fears have disappeared. Any thoughts of how the two would fit ping pong into their futures gone too. All that remains 
    is the sport itself and the players’ passion and energy for it, as Kazama thinks to himself,</p>     

<p style="font-size:14px;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is gradually pulling ahead. I feel am gradually being left
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behind. It’s clear who the better player is. But I don’t feel
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anxious. I’m hitting with all I got. I’m reacting with all I got. This
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is as far as I go, hero. My wings can’t take anymore. Will
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you bring me here again? I like this place. It’s glorious. (ep. 10)
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hero shows Kazama to play for fun, to go faster, not for fear of failure nor burden of legacy: 
    there is nothing to be afraid of. The hero shows the world champion the true pinnacle of table tennis: the pure dance of 
    a 2.7 gram plastic ball on table. The hero shows Kazama how to fly.</p>
    
<p style="text-align: center;">—</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peco’s right knee is in shambles: overtraining and a slew of intense matches have him coming into 
    this final with Smile with a significant hindrance. Smile, the exemplar of logical perfection in table tennis, knows what 
    to do, as he discusses with his coach before the match:</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against an opponent with a weak right knee, I’ll hit deep to the
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forehand, then switch to his backhand side.
    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question for you, Mr. Tsukimoto. What happens when someone
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goes after a hero’s weak point?
    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heroes don’t have weak points. (ep. 11)
</p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile understands that the Hero has returned—but resolves to make him prove it, to not hold back, 
    and to opt for a strategy that could end Peco’s career.</p>
    
<p style="text-align: center;">—</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As their match begins, Smile repeats the same mantra in his head that he has since the beginning of 
    the story: “My blood tastes like iron.” He embraces his robotic nature, drawing strength from cold precision.</p>
    
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Play begins with Smile’s serve, followed by a short opening exchange. Smile then enacts his strategy: 
    he hits deep to Peco’s right, then crosses the next shot to his left, forcing Peco to quickly change direction laterally, 
    and place incredible stress on his right knee. The show pauses on a collage of Peco’s pained face, the pressure on his knee, 
    and his Coach’s troubled expression.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Peco reaches the ball. He scrambles to fight his way back closer to the table. Once he returns 
    to even ground, he leaps into the air and ends the point with an unreturnable smash.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ball flies high up in the air, the series shows Smile smiling for the first time, depicted 
    staring into the ceiling, in total bliss.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thinks to himself—“Blood tastes like iron.”—a realization that his blood’s metallic taste was 
    not what made him different from others, but was what he had in common with all,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That his robotic mantra was actually an affirmation of his shared humanity so that he, like 
    Peco, can draw speed, strength, and motivation from the raw lifelike energy unique to humans,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that ping pong is fun, so he plays as hard as he can, for nothing else matters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hero has taught Smile to fly.</p>
