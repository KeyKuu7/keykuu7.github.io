<p><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently I was looking back at some of my old writings—from the end of senior year—for among the various entries of these docs,
     it is those written at the twilight of my high school career—of my school age career—those written standing at the very edge of the
      oh-so steep cliff that towered over the vast ocean of the 21st century world, that I am perhaps not most, but at least especially,
       proud of: not just of the words themselves, the vivid scenes capturing n-dimensional feelings mapping and deforming gelatine spikes 
       to dry, jade-green paint on drywall, the great distillation of eighteen years unto some paragraphs—not just any of those, but the
        thought, the incredible clarity I held, standing at the precipice between land and else, staring at the unknown (staring is too 
        narrow an action, I could see all, three-hundred and sixty degrees) from my high point, that clarity that one feels when they 
        not reminisce on the vast road behind them, but observe the TRULY INFINITE scene ahead; the sunless sky, the birdless cliff; 
        the wind-blown waves, the gusted clouds—small and stringy to full and fat and all in between; and the small image of a spike cast 
        onto the area of water directly below—the reflection of the conglomeration of the high, high cliff and I at its point, when 
        projected below, was simply a small, sharp, spike with a head on top, barely noticeable among the patterns of waves and armies 
        of clouds in the rest of the scene, insignificant in the broader hullabaloo.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That clarity was something I abused ardently; I thought, in terms of pure amount of experience distilled, 
    some of my best thought—I wrote some of my best writing. I created a time that future I’s could be nostalgic for (that this I is), 
    not understanding the pure monument of what I had achieved because I was too swept up by the great great gusts of wind I had 
    uncovered and too busy gliding and flying off them into the sea.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet a lot of this is likely simple nostalgia: the faults of the man who thinks that his mind is infallible, 
    that he’s mentally evolved past psychological pitfalls, and that he’s no longer the boy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the man, or boy, has grown. He is older; he has gained experience in the time elapsed. What ever happened 
    to him after he had decided to flap his wings during his magnificent plummet off the edge of a cliff? After he had broken out of the 
    post and chain that gave him confinement and control and drifted off into outer space? Where is he now?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been so long, and no time has passed at all.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is my life accelerating?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought scares me. Time is as long as we feel it; I don’t want to lose more of mine due to the electric 
    adaptations of my brain to the growing constancy and shrinking volume of my life. I leapt off the cliff not without fear, but with 
    courage, just as I flapped my arms, just as I drifted off—yet the courage has perhaps eroded, and the fear remains.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m still staring off to the sea. Uncharted realms lie before me. The INFINITE UNKNOWN and DESOLATE WASTELAND 
    ahead of me hasn’t gotten any smaller—the road behind me has only gotten longer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few months I had felt that it was all coming together, that I would no longer wander—no, I 
    was still wandering, but perhaps I hoped I would be an enlightened wanderer, one who at the very least, knew where he wanted to go, with 
    a scroll or tome in his hand, containing within it various wisdoms from the roads before, from wanderers past—no, not even that: 
    simply that I was progressing towards wandering no more, that I would, by the end of my life, be fully content, understand all, 
    and be enlightened (my life’s quest), yet with every step I take across the gravel, the bush, the sand, I see that this is instead 
    what it is to live, that I will constantly pursue, that the goal will never come.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I still hold hope that it will. I’ve begun to see hope as an extension of our human curiosity. A life’s 
    quest is to seek the aforementioned enlightenment and complete contentment. I wish to use my time here to construct these things, 
    to build up my experience and happiness bit by bit, to see if it is possible—if there exists a path to a heaven-on-earth that one 
    can walk in their lifetime. However, I do not see any path before me, and I do not see any way such a path can be created—the land 
    ahead is dense, dark, filled with monsters and great evil, and will devour my self, life, and soul should I seek to conquer it. 
    Yet I cannot know that such a path can’t be carved—to refute an existence statement is to show that it is fundamentally impossible 
    to construct what we seek to demonstrate. I am more limited to deny the possibility of enlightenment than I am in constructing it. 
    Thus, to embody our species’ rationality, truthfulness, and curiosity, I hope to lead a life content, full, and rich. I hope 
    because it is easier to stumble in search of a solution than it is to resign to an unverifiable impossibility.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might change the world.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, roll the dice.</p>
