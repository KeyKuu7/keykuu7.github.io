<h1>Lionel Yu</h1>
<h2 style="font-size:18px;">Update: December 6 - I was in the U.K. with my family over Thanksgiving break, and as vacation always is,
	it was a a period of perhaps profound reflection. We had toured Oxford for a day, and on the long Uber ride going there, gazing at the scrolling of
	 a foreign land, I was confronted with a feeling of yesteryear. I jotted down my thoughts at the time, but my friend at the newspaper 
	 here asked that I give her something so I made those thoughts half-decent: <a href="./CarseatReflections.html">"Carseat Reflections on an Uber to Oxford"</a>
