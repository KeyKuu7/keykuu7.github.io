<h1>Portrait of a First Year</h1>
<p>&#9Spring is upon us as winter wanes: quiet, crystal reflection melts away into fast, sustained energy. The wheel has turned once more, and the time has come once again to turn snowy thought into sure action.</p>

<p>&#9It all accelerates.</p>

<p>&#9Summer is like a hazy tiredness.</p>

<p>&#9Fall is like a beautiful melancholy,</p>
	
<p>&#9Or longing.</p>

<p>&#9Winter is contemplative and desolate.</p>

<p>&#9Spring is,</p>
<p>&#9&#9&#9_</p>

<p>&#9I blinked and a year has passed.</p>

<p>&#9I wear different clothes; my face is wiser and hollowed; the vast turbulences of my brain prior have ceased, with newer, deeper, subtler ones having taken their place: unsureties of yesteryear—so strong, manifested in brilliant metaphors of towering cliffs and infinite seas—are gently eroded in the unnoticeable chiseling of the quiet daily reflection in my life of the mind and are replaced by a softer, fuzzier thing—a quantum cloud of uncertainty, whose size, state, and shape as uncertain as itself—gentle television static in the corner of a room, unheard under conversation and thought, yet loud—not in magnitude, but in breadth—subtly overpowering pause and clarity.</p>

<p>&#9This last year, this first-year, has seen time and change both accelerate. The countless hours of classes and friends that filled my days in high school are spent here in transit: to and from class, the dining hall, rehearsals, Brunswick, New York for break, Coleman 201, 202, etc., Smith game room, and solitary excitement and social bliss.</p>

<p>&#9All and none of these are my life. Even the broader concept that encapsulates these, college, is not my life. My life was childhood, that’s all it was. My life is college now, but it won’t be in some years, and it wasn’t a year ago. The moment I was removed from one stage of life and placed into another, the scope of possibility, the vast dimension of life that mine could potentially inhabit, exploded from one to infinity in that very instant: like how one can generate every number only given 1 and the tool of addition (I have learned to add). That sheer temporal drop off a cliff face that was my high school graduation proved to me that whatever stage of life I may find myself in is purely transient, a-part not whole, and simply a stepping stone on my eighty-ninety year path from birth to nothing.</p>

<p>&#9My life isn’t definable anymore. I’m no longer the math-whiz, hockey-defenseman, existentialist-philosopher, quartet-violist I was in high school. I could be the soon-math-major table-tennis-defender transcendentalist-pseudo-philosopher seasonal-guitarist-violist I may be now, but it doesn’t feel the same. (I’m a soft pencil-gray silhouette living in the empty spaces of a notebook, sketched in transient boredom.) Before, all those threads ran concurrently—I moved between them when I left and entered classrooms, ice rinks—and certain times of day: early morning lesson then school then science olympiad then rehearsal then practice then csgo & repeat. Now the threads are all here, on this campus—I choose with each moment to go to the floor, the game room, Gibson, Searles, my laptop, my mind. And the threads are way tangled, pulling on each other, each spooling in seemingly random directions, a spaghetti-mess I cannot control (should I just eat it?). The pressure to pick a few threads, cut away others, and maybe grab some new ones to weave together a tapestry that I may call my life has burrowed itself into my consciousness, exerting a soft, vague pressure on the inside of my skull.</p> 

<p>&#9The world was so much narrower before; in moments of reflection such as these I would think on my life, that video gaming, high school attending, college approaching life: now the multiplicities of possibility, choice, and opportunity have blown up the scope of my world. In moments of reflection such as this I think on my lives, those wisdom seeking, art extracting, universe studying, music making, cafe sitting, prairie roaming, risotto eating, walking, running, skating, skipping lives. I could be all but I am none. In high school I had been walking a narrow cliffside path, dreaming of the freedom of landless life—I’ve soared off the edge, and now I’m overwhelmed by a duality of immense awe for the vast underwater world and momentous dread of my complete incapability of exploring it all.</p>

<p>&#9“I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life. And I am horribly limited.” - Sylvia Plath</p>

<p>&#9The posters by my bed I excitedly hung up in the fall stare at me now—that Pulp Fiction Uma Thurman that has watched my hair grow four inches, my mind become glass, and my wardrobe become stone. But she too, will go—in two weeks time to be rolled up, put into the good old Rav4 to maybe come back in a few months to live in Baxter or to be shut in a box in Chappaqua or to be thrown to the recycling truck. The Rav4 has also seen much: ten people the day I got my license; agents of chaos trying to crash into it; a traffic stop in New Hampshire; white claws thrown at it; four road tests (not all mine); and those dreamy 5am (morning or night) rides of orange cream coca-cola sky and time-independent liminality.</p>

<p>&#9Hellos and goodbyes and all in between,</p>
<p>&#9Fill this life that I seem to lead.</p> 

<p>&#9A first cycle has been completed, a gradual accumulation of people, activities, environments, building an eighteen year epic of my life growing up in Westchester, playing hockey from Long Island to D.C., playing League from 8PM to 5AM, and playing viola from Seven Bridges to Lincoln Center—and I’ve said my farewells to this life in many ways: tears in a locker room, the last post-concert ice cream run, a final performance—my very own—on Greeley’s stage, and many springtime midnight ventures through the windy roads and tree-lined parkways of Westchester with an assortment of passengers: Nikita, the sunrise, National Health, forming memories of a time soon to be left behind, Vansh, Cameron, Henry, sobs for lost loves and passions and activities and homes, bittersweetness, and a sense of open confusion belonging solely to me.</p>

<p>&#9Now a second cycle has started: my studies focus and deepen towards mathematics, a band will be formed, my writing once kept secluded in personal docs and journals takes flight on these pages, my table tennis gains spin and precision, the coffee grows sweeter. I walk slowly around this campus, this cycle of my life, aware that all this will be compressed into an orange-tinted frame in a reflecting mind in due time, yet excited to see my floor, to eat the big mac pizza, to skate at Watson, to record Mood For a Day, to play ping pong, to rehearse Rachmaninoff, to go to bed—and wake up once again.</p> 

<p>&#9Summer is coming; things will get lively again. My birthday’s soon. A first year in college, a nineteenth year of life. The Rav4 is coming to get me, to take me home to grand old Westchester and its small, pale sky, paved, wooded roads, and all the Dunkin Donuts, hockey rinks, schools, homes, soccer fields, tennis courts, concert halls, A&Ps, basements, delis, pizzerias, barber shops, and parks I grew up in. It’s ripping through Taconic, soaring through 84, and flying up 95—it’s come from the future to take me to my past and oh how I’ve missed those stained, beige fabric seats!</p>

<p>&#9But one day, after (perhaps before) a last drive from Brunswick to New York filled with newly old memories and broken things with a me behind the wheel with maybe longer hair, a soft grin comforting a slowly being realized sorrow that longs for a time just past, and a soul contemplating once again the open road that stretches for thousands of miles to the west side of the sky and its closed freedom and open certainty, the Rav4 too, shall go away, to be sold, driven, sold, driven, dumped, destroyed, and forgotten in a pile of old things by Wendy’s in Schenectady in view of that ancient looming General Electric sign that watches over all, while I’m off in Stavanger, Harbin, Gao, the Moon, or Kansas doing something I at present could never think of, being someone I have always dreamed of, and living a life I will not flee from.</p>
