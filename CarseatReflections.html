        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I blink my eyes and I am fifty.”</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one point when I was young I thought something similar: “One day I shall be in college, 
            all alone, without my mother nor my home.”</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shortness of span that one perceives between portions of their life, it is retroactive, 
            it wasn't always. I was a kid once, imagining the great plains of black-rock-dotted hills; they stretch onward to 
            the end of those clouds, so many, but it's just one mass, a great big gradient of fuzzy grays, filling in the blank 
            spaces between the branches and above the grass, a pattern behind green-brown mesh. I am on the other side of 
            those hills now. I mistake the immediacy of the memory for a quickness of crossing, that my past lives’ cohabitation
            with my current implies a closeness, one temporal.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look backwards and infinity is compressed into the blink of an eye.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forwards and it is still before me, standing: grand, peaceful, menacing, massive.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now shall live with then as the child dreaming in the car sits in the same back-left seat as 
            this young man dotting out wisps. They both gaze at the sky, seeing in it both breadth broader than all on the ground, 
            and also a precision, a depth, that one may zoom in forever on white/grey puffy pillow cotton string and find more and more.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a shame that our life be finite. The road behind me stays the same length: a single step. The land 
            before me shrinks, folds as we drive through it; it becomes known; it is defiled, no longer sacred and mysterious. It 
            leads to a cliff face. One day all memory shall live in a small bubble in my head. Decades of everything at my fingertips, 
            so small, meaningful to me, yet so close. Scenes of homes no longer, people now withered, and times long past stand together 
            tightly packed in a crowd. They are right behind me. (They do not cheer me on; they stare with hope and fear.) If I could 
            walk backwards, they'd be right there. One step away. Forwards, past the cliff-edge, lies the black sea, too, separated 
            by single step. Great ocean of ink, sloshing viscously like black oil, spilled and spilled into the ocean. Its waves’ 
            ferocity signals a certain life within, but it’s one hungry, primal. Before the big bang there were monsters; this 
            black sea below is where they yet persist. Insignificant memory and infinite oblivion sandwich me from back and front. 
            I am squeezed in that moment. There is nothing I may do. Memory grows slightly larger. I plummet.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I still stare at this grand, gray English sky. Clouds bigger than I could ever be scoot along. 
            Heaps of sheeps trot along a grey plane. There is a book in my lap; I don’t feel like reading it right now. Clouds drift 
            by like people and trees. The heaviness of the accumulation of memory and the piercing fear of annihilation relent slightly, 
            as time passes; shadows of tabletop cups and vases lengthen; darkened soaked sand is revealed as tide shrinks.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I blink once more.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We arrive to Oxford.</p>
